# The Crafting UX Web Project Template

## What's included  
Everything you need to 

### Developing your website locally
1. Install your project's dependencies.

2. Start your server with `npm start`. Test it by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Connecting your app to heroku
1. Create an account at [heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/)
2. Create a new app at [https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps). Your app url will be `your-project-name.herokuapp.com`.
3. Go to your app's **Deploy** tab and connect the app to your GitHub repo on Heroku.
4. Enable automatic deploys from GitHub from the 'master' branch. Now, everytime you push new updates to `master`, heroku will pick-up the change and deploy the updates to your website.

#### Reading the app logs
The server that runs your app has a log you can tap into to see the status of your site.
